// Inheritance and the prototype

/*
In programming, inheritnace refers to passing down characteristics from parent to a child so that a new piece of code can be reuse and build upon the features of an exiting one.

JavaScript implements inheritance by using objects. Each object has an internal link to another object called its prototype. That prototype object has its own prototype obejct and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype.
